# Teamwork Questionnaire for Julien Pecquet

1. __What is your personality type?__
   INFJ: Apparently I'm Remus Lupin :O I'm a wearwolf so we probably shouldn't study at night.
   An explanation I found on the internet:
   Seek meaning and conneciton in ideas, relationships, and the natural world. 
   Want to understand what motivates people and are insightful about others. 
   Organized and decisive in implementing their ideas. Private, intuitive and complex by nature.
1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   Reach me by Slack, text preferably. Email works as well, but I almost never check voicemails so just call again or text.
   My school schedule is roughly 12 til 5 Mon thru Fri, but there are gaps in that schedule.
   I have my phone and sometimes my laptop with me at school, so I'll see your message. Probably won't be able to review or
   help with code or projects within 12 - 5 weekdays though.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   ACCOMPLISH EVERYTHING! Okay, so we will work together to become as cohesive a unit as we possibly can. 
   I am someone who really strives to achieve A's in every CS course, so I am going to try my very best to meet every requirement.
   I expect we, at the very least, all try our best to learn a lot in the course. This should translate to getting good grades.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   I am personally worried I may be a lone wolf. I want to break out of my shell and work more with others. 
   I also believe that communication is key in everything from friendships, romantic relationships, work relationships, etc.
   However, I am someone who struggles with it when things get emotional or when conflict arises. This is something I want to overcome.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   It is possible we may not work together smoothly, as I have never worked on a team when it comes to computer science.
   Similarly, I have never been a leader for a team, only a following or a component to the whole. 
   Becoming more agile and adaptive is something we all probably will have to work on, but I KNOW it is something I need to work on.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   Haha, this is probably something we will deal with. 
   The way that our CEO handles things, I think that the person who wants an A will still be able to achieve this.
   I just hope that everyone is respectful of each other and we try to accomodate everyones desires.
   However, when goals contradict or overlap each other, we will need to talk it out and find a solution that works for everyone.
   At least, something that works for 3/4.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   I believe it is acceptable for some team member to do more work on AN assignment, maybe TWO assignments.
   But this is NOT acceptable if it happens the entire semester. Please, team, don't let me do this, and I will reciprocate the favor.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   Well, it seems like we need to spend about an hour a day on this class to be successful. So I am going to plan accordingly.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   It really depends... We all have different interests and skills, but I'm sure we all want to round out our weak points.
   I think that, generally speaking, if we all have busy schedules we should all take point on what we individually are good at.
   Maybe on slower weeks, we should each take something which is difficult for us, so that we can learn more and be better off in the long run.
   This is really a project to project matter in my opinion.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   We need to call them on it! We shouldn't simply take up their work. This should be dealt with immediately!
   I think it is fair that if this happens once, it should be a warning and have the other 3/4 of the team agree on what we should do.
   If it happens twice, we should talk to our CEO, as this can't be a regular thing if we want to succeed.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   We should set unambiguous and objective qualities which we need to meet (sort of like a grading rubric) so that there is no discrepancy.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   As long as we can find a way to all work together to deliver a "product" we are HONESTLY proud of, work habits shouldn't be an issue.
   Unless they are destructive or procrastinating, this should be easily dealt with through active communication and teamwork.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   I am open to this idea, but am unsure of the ACTUAL workload of the class yet. I imagine this would be a good idea if everyone else thinks so.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   Once a week, maybe twice at end of sprint?
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   Maybe approval from 1 on a small decision, approval by 2 or 3 on big decision?
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   Work it out! We shouldn't get hung up on this or get emotional, we should be rational and try to find a solution.
   If we cant find a solution then maybe the 1 member needs to accept that they cant always get their way. 
   NO. GRUDGES. If we begin to have unspoken dissonance amongst the team it will only get toxic if not dealt with quickly.
   Please, if we are doing things that others dont approve of, let's talk about it and find a solution. I don't see any other way.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   Depends on how well it's working, honestly! Don't micromanage me please, but I definitely don't mind if someone is taking the lead on a project.
   Preferably, this will only be on a specific sprint. We should definitely mix and match roles and leader could definitely be a role we need.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   This was my answer to almost everything: communicate!
   I'll tell my team if I don't like it or if I can't handle it, and hope they can be supportive and help out.
