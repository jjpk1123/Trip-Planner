# Trip Planning Application

This program features a front end website written using Bootstrap 4 as well as a back end Java server. It was made with the purpose of helping to plan *any* trip *anywhere in the world*. One way it would help is by finding the shortest possible path for the entire trip. Of course, this is a still un-solved problem, so it uses heuristics such as 2-opt and 3-opt to get a *very good* path. 

This repo is not going to be worked on anymore and is purely here to show past work. It is a clone of a shared repository which I copied for ease of access.

I am not the only author of this code.
