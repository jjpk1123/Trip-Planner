# Teamwork Questionnaire for _yournamehere_

1. __What is your personality type?__
   * INFP. "The mediator". 
1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text is best. Phone calls work too. If you tag me in slack I will see it, otherwise I might not. 
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect that our team will be able to have a working model of each project before the deadline. I want every project to work, thats really my only expectation. As a team I hope we will be able to work together. 
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I sometimes can come off as shy, but I've been working on it. I try to help when I can, and I think my goals are to improve my communication skills in general. Sometimes I'm not great about voicing my opinions. 
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * If the team doesn't mesh well, that could be a big issue. I think we will be able to work well together however. Nobody in this team seems like a hitchhiker, so I'm hoping that won't be an issue either. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * This very well may happen. I think it's in our best interest to always shoot for an A, but sometimes it might not happen. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I think if it is forced work, as in someone didn't finish their part and you are picking up their slack, no. If it is voluntary, sure! If that person want's to do more than we asked of them to ensure their A then I think they should be allowed to do so, as long as they are the only ones getting credit for their extra work. 
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * at least 10-15 hours per week.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * I think we should discuss who is more comfortable with what, and if someone has more experience in something and it would be easier for them than another teammate, it should be split that way. 
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * We should hold them to it. I think obviously things happen, we are all taking other classes. Just don't make it a habit. I'm fine with bailing somebody out a once or twice but if it becomes a habit I won't be helping anymore. 
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * I think we should listen to everybody. If a majority says it's bad, then we should fix it up. If only one person thinks it is bad, maybe it should be on them to fix what they don't like. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * team members may work however they please, as long as their work is done on time. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I would like to have a meeting time that we know we can and will all show up to. I am free all day fridays, preferably mornings. We can work out specifics in slack. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * at least 3 times weekly, but it is dependent on how the work is going and if we feel we are in a good grove we may be able to skip or add meetings. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * If the decision is big enough to impact our grade, I would say that we should all have a say in it. If it is down to the wire and we can't get ahold of everyone, then maybe that could be an exception. 
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * seriously listen to everyones opinion, even if they are the outlier. Everyone's opinion is valid, no matter what. The final decision may be left to the majority, but make sure everyone is at least seriously considered. 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Try to talk to that one person and let them know how you feel. Communication between all of us is key. 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I would try to spread out the responsibilities. I don't like being in charge of everything. It is more work, plus you are then responsibile soley for every decision. I like some variation.
