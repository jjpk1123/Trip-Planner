# Sprint 3 - *T17* - *Quixotic Quetzals*

## Goal

### Shorter trips and more places to go!
### We will implement more user centered designs, including letting the user decide what options to show in the itinerary, letting the user plan the shortest trip, letting the user create a trip from places in a database. 
### Sprint Leader: *Ezra Huston*

## Definition of Done

* Web application deployed on the production server (kiwis.cs.colostate.edu).
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint.md).
* Product Increment release `v3.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the Release Notes template, and the arhived files.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>3.0</version>`.
* Javadoc and unit tests for public methods.
* Coverage of at least 75% total for all classes.
* Bring and maintain code maintainability to a B (5%-10%).


## Policies

* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests pull requests for master branch always.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* Change interface to satisfy newly discovered needs / bug squash
* Change between miles or kilometers
* Give the user an option to view a shorter trip
* Clean code
* Code coverage (at least 75%)
* Give the user the option to choose what information to display in the itinerary.
* Build a trip from existing information

*Include a discussion of planning decisions made based on your velocity from previous sprints.*
* We took into account our knowledge of the code, and the things we didn't know, and rated Epics as we saw fit. Thing we considered were how familiar we were with working on things like databases, how long it took us to build similar code in sprint2, and who would be doing what parts.
