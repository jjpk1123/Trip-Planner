# Teamwork Questionnaire for _yournamehere_

1. __What is your personality type?__
   * ISFP, or "The Adventurer"
2. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text, any.
3. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * My goals are simple. Be on top of our work. I've hit more than a few speedbumps, but this should be a good one.
4. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * We have Slack. I'd like to be more communicative of what's going on than I have been in the past.
5. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I'm a bit shy, and occasionally fall back into a bit of a "hermit" mode. 
6. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I'd like to think the B folks would step it up. I know I'm in the A camp this semester. 
7. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * I'd be a bit bothered if this happened. I'd like to think the work load would be spread out. Short answer: Not exactly.
8. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Probably 10ish.
9. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Initially I'd like to see volunteers. Beyond that, I think it prudent to spread the love, so to speak. Dabble in everything.
10. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * If Life(tm) happens, then it happens. That said, we should really talk to them about this. If that becomes a trend, talk to Dave.
11. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * This depends upon if it's a matter of "This is bad" vs "This could be better." If the former, then it's definitely worth a discussion. 
   * If the latter, then I could see it being on that individual to implement the improvement.
12. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * The biggest and best thing we can do is discuss it. As long as the work load is fairly well spread out, it's all good.
13. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I'm open to this. Whether or not that is required we'll see.
14. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Once a week is probably adequate.
15. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * This is too broad to answer with one statement. Depends on how big of a deal it is. Usually, I think yes. 
16. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Step one is try to reconcile that disagreement. If not, majority rules.
17. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Ask this person to step down a little bit. Taking charge is one thing, but control is a bit much.
18. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I'm pretty fine with this. Though if it becomes an issue, ask someone to step up.
