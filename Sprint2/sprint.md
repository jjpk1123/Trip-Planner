# Sprint 2 - t17 - Quixotic Quetzals

## Goal

### A mobile, responsive map and itinerary!
### Sprint Leader: Julien Pecquet

## Definition of Done

* Web application ready for demo and potential customer release.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint.md).
* Product Increment release `v2.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the Release Notes template, and the arhived files.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>2.0.0</version>`.
* Javadoc and unit tests for public methods.

## Policies

* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests pull requests for master branch always.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* Plan trips in the state of Colorado
* Load button
* Save button
* Display map
* Show itinerary
* Adjust itinerary
* Adjust trip order

*Include a discussion of planning decisions made based on your velocity from previous sprints.*
* We left some things which were less important so we can focus on team building and organization in the required tasks. Our primary issue has been communications, and learning new technology. This should set us up for a polished demo, and for good growth as a team.
