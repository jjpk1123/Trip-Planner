# Sprint 5 - *t17* - *Quixotic Quetzals*

## Goal

### Interoperability and User Defined Design
### Sprint Leader: *Julien Pecquet*

## Definition of Done

* Web application deployed on the production server (kiwis.cs.colostate.edu).
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint.md).
* Product Increment release `v5.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the Release Notes template, and the archived files.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>5.0</version>`.
* Javadoc and unit tests for public methods.
* Coverage at least (60%) overall.
* Keep code maintainability at an (B) average.

## Policies

* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests pull requests for master branch always.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* #273 Interop
* #274 Shorter trips
* #278 Update the User Interface

* Our last two sprints we have completed around 35-40 storypoints as a team, and we believe this is a good estimation of our ability. However, we believe that previously we were overestimating our ability, thus underestimating our storypoints. I believe we are probably doing more like 50 storypoints but underestimating how long things take and not adjusting it. For this sprint, we decided to go with the strategy of promising less than we think we can do, and adding things if our velocity is faster than expected.
