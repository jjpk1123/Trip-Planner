# Teamwork Questionnaire for Michael Smith

1. __What is your personality type?__
   * ISFJ -- "The Defender"
1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text is best, even if I don't respond right away. I will read/act upon texts when awake. I'll give my work/sleep schedule, as it might be easier to explain when I _won't_ be checking the t17 group on Slack: 
     * I work midnight to 8 am, Thursday through Sunday, so I won't be able to log in to a computer, but can read/respond then. Make sure to keep your phone on silent when you sleep!
     * I generally sleep from 4pm to 11pm.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I expect our team to:
     * act in unison as a team, even if it means keeping each other in check (couch potato/hitchhiking is the result of the lack of effort at an individual level)
     * communicate with logic, instead of blasting away with heated emotion, but sometimes it is inevitable.
     * have fun and learn along the way!
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I have always been shy, and after adjusting to the team dynamic, we should all "blossom" into hard-working and determined group members together.
   * If I know how to do something, and someone else doesn't, I will communicate how to accomplish said subtask, and I hope it gets reciprocated!
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Lack of effort at an individual level will hinder the collective team's morale. Time management is crucial in learning and adapting to a new environment.
   * No one is perfect, but as long as you give it your all, we should all leave with an A.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * This class will allow for the hard-workers to shine, and the allocation of points will not always be split evenly. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Some may have more time to work on an assignment, and the team's "grading" should be truthful. Manipulation and demanding pity will not be tolerated. 
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * Situation dictates, but generally, we should expect to work for longer than the project calls for, to allow for re-reading the project requirments, as well as learning tools.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * First, we'll volunteer for pieces (25% each), and eventually we'll know what we can handle better. That's the point of learning!
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * The team's grading will reflect each individual's GitHub commits/work. If you feel bad for not contributing as much, use that guilt to drive you to do better, and not just take it as a loss.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We should hold each other to the same standard we hold ourselves to, especially in this class. 
   * We're all introverts here, and I find them to be the hardest workers, yet the quitest bunch. 
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * We need early commits on crucial elements of an assignment. Late commits will result in merge conflicts, thus componding fixes will need to be addressed. To prevent this, push beginning work early. 
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I do not require a meeting time, but I am okay if we decide on meeting to discuss elements on a project. I will practically live at the CS computer labs, where we can discuss/code at the same place and communicate there. 
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Once a week is minimum, but that means we'll need to be in the labs for 6+ hours for that one day. 
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Not every team member, but situation dictates the answer to this question. If there's a dicussion on Slack and three members are in a group text about a decision and the last doesn't answer in a reasonable time, then the show muist go on.
   * Splitting the work up is the only thing I think we should all be physically present for, and vounteer for pieces of the work (split evenly).
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * We should ask the reason as to why they disagree and come up with a compromise, as long as they aren't manipulating us to make their work load less than even.
   * But if the three think this is the best course of action, then we shopuld take a minute to explain the reason as to why we feel this is best. 
     * Debates are healthy, arguments are destructive. Emotions can lead to arguments, and logic will prevail. 
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * It's a "team" process, and no _one_ should be the supervisor. If we all believe we're equals, then this shouldn't ever be an issue! 
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Communication amongst the team is the most important aspect of successful relations. If one team member is expected to get the ball rolling, then we have failed as a team. A little motivation is one thing, but constantly can be an issue.
   * Again, introverts are generally shy, but this class will force us to open up to each other; let's make it a healthy team.
